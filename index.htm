      <h1>Hey!</h1>
      <p>
        You're probably wondering "who is this nerd and why does this website
        look like ass", well I'm Human, and I'm still working on my site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, I'm working on a static site generator, I made several so
        far, all bad in their own special little ways, but I kept on postponing
        updating this site because of it. Once the SSG is done, I will be able
        to update this site much more easily.
