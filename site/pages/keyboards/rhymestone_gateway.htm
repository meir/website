        This is a new keyboard i wanna make.
        My biggest motivation for this is because i want an even smaller keyboard than the planck, just to try out.
        I also want to make a keyboard that is more compact, thats why its good that its a split.
        Mostly because i got a spare storage thingie that my cable came in and i wanna use that to store the keyboard so i can take it to work.
    </p>
    <p>
        One priority of the keyboard is that i want to make it as silent as i can, because i want to be able to use this at work without complaint.
        This is why im probably gonna invest in a lot of foam.
    </p>
    <p>
        For now i just need to wait until both the keycaps and the keyboard arrive.
    </p>

        I already have the switches ready, for this keyboard i chose to go with Gazzew Bobagums.
        This is the first keyboard thats gonna use them.
        I mostly chose them since i absolutely love the Gazze Boba switches and i wanted to try out the silent version.
        So far i've noticed even with them being the silent version, i probably need to get some foam to make them even more silent.

        The choice for the keycaps is because i dont want to use anything weird or confusing for at work.
        People are gonna see this so if i make it too cute, people are gonna suspect things ðŸ‘€.
        I also wanted to use this set since im a big fan of portal and i feel like it fits this keyboard a lot since its a split keyboard.
        and like... thats the entire deal of portal, 2 seperate halves.

        Aswell as that this is gonna be the first time for me having Salvun keycaps, so im excited to see what they're like.
