        This is a keyboard im planning on getting, the group buy for round 2 has not started yet so im waiting on it still.
        It is planned to run at the end of February 2023.
        
        I do have the keycaps ready in a bag waiting to be mounted, im thinking of combining these with some Gazzew Bobagums.
        Still need to get some lube for the stabilizers and actually get some cool stabilizers.
