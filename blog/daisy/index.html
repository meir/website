The idea came because of my frustration with constantly having to update dependencies, get the pipeline updated, and fix everything thats outdated.
I'ts a never ending cycle in javascript frameworks and I never really wanted another project I have to maintain just to write this.

So now I made another project I have to maintain just to write this, but no more dependency hell I guess?</p><a href="https://github.com/meir/daisy" target="_blank">Daisy on GitHub</a><h2>What is this?</h2><p>The answer is simple, this is a transpiler that turns a custom made-up language into static HTML so that I can just put it on GitHub pages and never look at it again.

Should you use this? Not really? 
I made this to be what I want it to be, but it's nowhere anything I dream of it being.
For example, ideally I want improved SEO checks, RSS generation, Accessibility checks and Semantics requirements.

This will probably take forever to implement while I'm still at the part where I need to add comments, tests, refactors, etc. still.</p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>So the way Daisy works is that it parses all the files beforehand in the source folder, these are all your webpages.

All of them will be assigned a url depending on their file location or the url specified in the meta block.
After that they go through the runtime where they can import files which all will be added in the store of the resolver.
And finally all the results from the resolver will be saved into their output locations.

This is what a meta block looks like:</p><pre><code>meta {
  str url = "/blog/daisy"
}</code></pre><h3>Types.</h3><p>Daisy has a couple of types that can be used, theyre quite basic at the moment and don't have a lot of underlying methods or anything.</p><pre><code>str a = "string"
num b = 1
float c = 1.2
bool d = true
element e = : div > "element"
func f = (str input) str { return input }
map g = { str key = "value" }
list h = [ "value", 1 ]</code></pre><p>as you can see aswell, functions arent specifically functions, you just assign them in a variable definition as I want to keep the language as stupid as possible.

The same applies to lists and maps, I want to keep the language statically typed but maps and lists are straightup variable scopes, meaning theyre dynamic with their content, but the definitions in them are not.
This means if you have a map such as <code>map x = { str field = "value"}</code> then <code>field</code> will always be a string.</p><h3>Elements.</h3><p>One big requirement of this project to me was how to define elements.
I really dislike how HTML is basically just XML, I wanted to change this.
We already have a much better option for this (sort of) in my opinion, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors">CSS Selectors.</a>
If we already have a solution to query elements using shorthands, then why can't we create them using those same shorthands?

That's why I decided to create elements simply by stating the tag straightoff, if you want a class, add them using a dot and for an ID add it with a pound/hashtag.
For other attributes, just define them right after as if it's inside the HTML already.
Due to limitations with the parser, since LALRPOP does not support look ahead, starting a block of elements has to start using a colon.

What does this look like?<pre><code>element x = : html {
  head > title > "Document title"
  body {
    main {
      nav > ul {
        li > h1#website-name > "Super Duper Cool Website"
        li > a#home.link href="/" > "Home"
        li > a#blog.link href="/blog" > "Blog"
        li > a#about.link href="/about" > "About"
      }

      section#content {
        h2#content-title > "Super Duper Cool Title"
        p > ''
          Welcome to my super duper cool website! B)
        ''
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>After parsing and building this, this will result into the following:</p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;
      Document title
    &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
      &lt;nav&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;h1 id="website-name"&gt;Super Duper Cool Website&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a id="home" class="link" href="/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a id="blog" class="link" href="/blog"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a id="about" class="link" href="/about"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/nav&gt;
      &lt;section id="content"&gt;
        &lt;h2 id="content-title"&gt;Super Duper Cool Title&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Welcome to my super duper cool website! B)
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre><p>There's much more going on in the background and some extra features such as importing files using methods.
