Recently I came across <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>.
It was explained to me as the next-gen C. I've tried C before but always left with a sour taste in my mouth due to the amounts of <code>segmentation fault. (Core dumped)</code> with no handholding to get into the language.</p><blockquote>"Core dumped? Have you tried fixing their relationship?" ~friendo</blockquote><p>Anyways, in order to understand the basic syntax, I quickly made a Matrix struct with some methods.
One thing that surprised me is that arrays with a set size need their size determined at compile time.
This was instantly my first introduction to <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.14.1/#At-Compile-Time">compile time</a> which is a specific keyword in Zig.

And from this I learned quickly that this language is almost at the level of difficulty of C but with errors that make sense to humans.

For example, the solution to making an array with a set size turned out to require an <a href="https://zig.guide/standard-library/allocators/">Allocator</a> to claim memory in the stack for a known size.
This already terrifies and intrigues me.</p><h2>The plan.</h2><p>Recently I've also been talking to a friend of mine, and I've been wanting to get into radio technology.
If I can, most possibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy">radio astronomy</a>.

For this there's one big thing that's used for any piece of radio tech software, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor">DSP (Digital Signal Processor)</a>.
Ofcourse this includes a lot of research and learning, so this blog/guide/exploration(?) is not done yet.
This is only the first part of a long road to learn more things that intrigue me.</p><p>If you're curious what my first step is going to be or if you want to get started aswell, this is one of the resources I found that looks very promising: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuh62Q4Sv7BUSzx5Jr8Wrxxn-U10qG1et">Digital Signal Processing on YouTube</a></p></section><script data-input-position="bottom" data-repo="meir/website" data-lang="en" data-loading="lazy" data-strict="0" data-reactions-enabled="1" data-emit-metadata="0" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://giscus.app/client.js" data-theme="https://yesimhuman.dev//giscus-14629352936808272518.css" data-category-id="DIC_kwDOIyQOzM4CkKe5" data-mapping="pathname" async="" data-repo-id="R_kgDOIyQOzA"></script></article><footer><div id="footer-images"><img loading="lazy" alt="lgbtq" id="lgbtq" src="/assets/images/flag_pride.png"></img><img alt="trans" src="/assets/images/flag_transgender.png" loading="lazy" id="trans"></img><img alt="nonazi" id="nonazi" src="/assets/images/nonazi.png" loading="lazy"></img></div><span>Last generated: 19/08/2025 @ 08:54</span><a id="license" href="/LICENSE/index.html">MIT @ 2025</a></footer></main><script async="">(function load_hljs() {
